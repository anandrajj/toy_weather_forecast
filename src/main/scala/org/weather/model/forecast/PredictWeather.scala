 * 	 			Entry point for the weather forecast application, it collects the cities to which weather has to be forecasted,
 * downloads observation data. Then users ARIM time series analysis, to predict the various weather conditions like average
 * temperature(Â°C), Relative Humidity(%) and Pressure(hPa).
 *
 * Outlook of the day is predicted using max cloud cover in the forecast period, Average sunshine hours and the above mentioned
 * 3 predicted parameters.
